# nepi_edge_sw_mgr #
This repository provides the implementation of the nepi_edge_sw_mgr, which is a utility module for installing software to NEPI-enabled devices over a cloud connection to NEPI-CONNECT.

At present, this module is not used or maintained. It is preserved to satisfy NEPI-BOT import directives and in anticipation of reviving this functionality one day.
