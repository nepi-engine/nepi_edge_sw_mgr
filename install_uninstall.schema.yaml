# This file provides an example/schema for the install.yaml and uninstall.yaml files
# that exist throughout a NEPI Edge SOFTWARE folder hierarchy. Sections are organized as
# separate YAML 'documents', delineated by --- lines.
---
# Top-level Component Description -- Must come first and be fully populated
component_name: MY-COMPONENT # Required. All CAPS, no spaces semantics
version: '1.0.0' # Required. All directories in the hierarchy are individually versioned. Should follow semantic versioning scheme
---
# An instruction sequence provides an ordered list of instructions to be executed on the device for component installation/modification
# Instructions are executed in order in a sequence. If an instruction fails, all subsequent instructions in that sequence are aborted.
# The following instruction sequence provides examples of all supported instruction types.
instruction_sequence:
  # dependency_check verifies existence of each file in the list. Absence of any of the files or insufficient directory read
  # permission for the account executing the nepi_edge_sw_mgr results in a failure for this instruction
  - dependency_check:
    - /full/path/to/first/dependency.txt
    - /full/path/to/second/dependency.bin

  # file_install copies a file to the specified location on the device filesystem. Failure of the initial copy or failure of any modification
  # to the permissions owner/group or failure to establish a specified symlink is considered failure of this instruction.
  - file_install:
      source: ./my_favorite_script.py # Required. Path is with respect to the folder in which this component resides
      destination: /full/path/to/destination/my_favorite_script.py # Required, must include filename. Strongly suggested to use an absolute path here
      permissions: '777' # Optional. Standard R/W/X permissions formatted as an octal number string. If not present, will use permissions of source
      owner: my_username # Optional. Can also specify unix user ID as a numeric string. If not present, will use the user account under which nepi_edge_sw_mgr is running
      group: my_user_group # Optional. Can also specify unix group ID as a numeric string. If not present, will use the user account under which nepi_edge_sw_mgr is running
      symlink: /full/path/to/symbolic/link/destination # Optional. Will create a symbolic link to the destination file

  # file_delete removes a file from the filesystem. Non-existence of the file or insufficient permissions result in instruction failure
  # Typically, file_delete is part of an uninstall.yaml file, but can be included in install.yaml if required during component installation
  - file_delete: /path/to/a/file/to/be/deleted.txt

  # directory_delete removes an entire directory from the filesystem. Non-existence of the directory or insufficient permissions result in instruction failure
  # Typically, directory_delete is part of an uninstall.yaml file, but can be included in install.yaml if required during component installation
  - directory_delete: /path/to/a/directory/to/be/deleted
---
# A single component.yaml file may contain multiple instruction_sequences. This can be helpful to separate
# sets of instructions that should not be aborted on failure of an instruction in a different sequence
instruction_sequence:
  - file_install:
    source: ./a/file/that/must/be/installed/independent/of/previous/instruction_sequence
    destination: /full/path/to/destination
